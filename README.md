## About archtorify

**Archtorify** is a shell script for [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) which use [iptables](https://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html) settings to create a transparent proxy through the Tor Network, the program also allows you to perform various checks like checking the Tor Exit Node (i.e. your public IP when you are under Tor proxy) or if Tor has been configured correctly checking service and network settings.


## Getting started

To know how to use the program see the [wiki](https://github.com/brainfucksec/archtorify/wiki).


## Thanks

* This program would not exist without the users of [Arch Linux Community](https://bbs.archlinux.org/) that helped me in the building of the AUR package and the guides of the [Tor Project official website](https://www.torproject.org/)

* A special thanks goes also to the [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/) Team and their [documentation](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Documentation)
