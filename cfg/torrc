## Configuration file for Tor
## 
## See 'man tor', or https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html,
## for more options you can use in this file.
##
## Tor will look for this file in various places based on your platform:
## https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#torrc

## Logs to /tmp to prevent digital evidence to be stored on disk
Log notice file /tmp/archtorify.log

## The directory for keeping all the keys/etc. By default, we store
## things in $HOME/.tor on Unix, and in Application Data\tor on Windows.
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor

## Still if you cannot start the tor service, run the service using root 
## (this will switch back to the tor user).
User tor
